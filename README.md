--------------------Description--------------------

This project is inspired by my early experineces with the internet, along with my culture. As a person who grew up in an environemtn where I am constantly effected by the great firewall, I always had significant awareness that the so-called 'world-wide-web' is not as universal and 'world-wide' as eveyone expects it to be. Things like goverment control, language barriers, and region specific web features divide the web like a barrier. Therefore, I want to convay this complex emotion that surrounds the internet I grew up with. The main themes that surround this project include cencorship, chinese web culture, and nostalgia.

On the first page of the website, there are 3 hidden links that only appear when the cursor hovers over them. Through those links, the users goes throgh a journey of discovery through the website, almost like walking through a maze. there is no final destination, but the point lies more in seeing how much you can discover. there are 7 pages in total including the index page. 

Challanges.......

--------------------Summary of case studies--------------------
1) https://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html

keepingupappearences is a website where sinister sections of a story are hiudden until the user hovers thier cursor over a specific line to reveal the truth. I really like how the user has to discover the finer details of the story on thier own accord instead of the website leading the user along the narrative. Even though the phrases don't link to anything, the element of ‘discovery’ almost makes me feel like i'm peeling back on onion. this is the main case study that influenced me to involve cencorship in my project in the first place. 

2) https://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/

the main element that facinated me in jodi.org is that the website almosts seems neverending. the process of navigatin gthe website is confusing, and the aesthetic of the site hurts my eyes sometimes. However, I still really like how non-linear the website is. 

jodi.org had aesthetic and function influences on my project. the glitchy, highly saturated colours of jodi is something I often impliment in some pages of my own project. 

3) https://likepearls.com/

likepearls.com is the main website that inspired page 1 of my project, where a bunch of chinese meme gifs are placed all accross the page like a college. whilst likepearls.com is a commentray on sexuality and cencorship, my meme college is more of an abstract recreation of early chinese internet and the aesthetic of social spaces at the time. 

--------------------Reflection--------------------

if I had more time ans resources, I would definately add even more webpages to this project. with 7 pages only, the experience could end very quickly, and the sense of being lost in the website might not be developed enough. furthermore, I also want to maybe add more audio experiences to the websites.
