        <!--comment-->
        <!--when I was researching how to achieve the bouncing logo affect, I noticed that a lot of tutorials used keyframes.-->
        <!--I didnt like this approach, becuase I wanted the images to be independent and dynamic.-->
        <!--However, it seems like if I wanted to get multiples images that bounces around the screen dynamically, I would have to write a script file and make formulas to simulate actual physics.-->
        <!--So, I had to stick to one bouncing logo instead of multiple.-->
